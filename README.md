# DecisionTreeLearning
This was the final project for my Artificial Intelligence Course

The purpose of this project was to teach an algorithm to guess whether a voter was a republican or democrat 
based upon voting habits. The algorithm is given a larger training set of data and the voter attributes (the
items being voted on) and is trained with this data to predict the party of future voters. 

I have included all of the input files for this project including two files with restaurant data that was used
for testing as they are smaller files.
